            The common thread in my professional life has been education and
            service. My goal in my next role is to of course use my newly
            acquired knowledge in programming, but also take advantage of my
            pedagogical background.

              I was part of a new program which intends to increase diversity in
              a workplace by taking in people with different types of
              backgrounds and experiences. In this program, I had the
              opportunity to work with SCSS, Typescript and React, some EPI and
              learn more about the agile method of working. We also got to learn
              some back end in the program but unfortunately, I did not have the
              possibility of using it in my work at the time but I am now
              studying C# and hope to have the possibility to use it in my
              future day-to-day work. I learned a lot about how to work in an
              agile work culture as well, and what it means to be part of a
              team.

              As a mentor, I had the shared responsibilities of a class of 28
              students. I handled conflicts within the class, was responsible
              for group activities with my co-mentor, and maintained contact
              with parents and other school resources if needed. As a language
              teacher, I did all the planning for my three classes of different
              levels, graded and gave feedback for further development. This
              position required a lot of structure, stress management, and
              flexibility.

              At Lärande AB, I had different roles. At first, I began as a high
              school teacher teaching history, religion, and social sciences.
              When the temp job was over, I got hired by the company's lower
              grades school. Here I held classes in Spanish and civic education
              for all ages between grades 6 and 9. This was my first
              introduction to teaching after my university studies. It taught me
              how to lead, how to be quick on my feet, and how to problem-solve.

              I worked for a couple of seasons at Kolmården Zoo as part of their
              service personnel. I handled all of the attractions at the zoo but
              mostly worked on the cable cars and the rollercoaster. The years I
              worked for Kolmården Zoo gave me an education in service and
              management. It also taught me how to best communicate with other
              people.

              A fast paced Bootcamp, where we focused on Javascript, React,
              HTML5, CSS and also did some server-side programming with Node.js.
              We worked with Agile methodology through weekly sprint planning,
              check-ins, demos, and reflections. The projects were done
              individually, in pairs, and in groups.

              I chose to add Spanish as a third subject to teach since its
              already a native language of mine. Language studies gave me a lot
              that can benefit me as a programmer, for example, the process
              through which you learn a human language and a programming
              language is very similar. I noticed how this benefited me when I
              studied at the Frontend Bootcamp.
