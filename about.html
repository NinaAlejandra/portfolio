            The common thread in my professional life has been education and service. My goal in my next role is to of course use my newly acquired knowledge in programming, but also take advantage of my pedagogical background.

                Teaching and mentoring a class of 7 graders taught me so many valuable things, such as leadership, empathy and guidance. Being a teacher of foreign languages taught me patience, how to break down something into smaller parts, which is something I value as a programmer and documentation as in documenting their progress.

                <p>
                 At LiU I studied to become a teacher in History and Religion, as these subjects are a special interest of mine, Religion especially so. This programme taught me pedagogical strategies, leadership theories, and different types of learning. Out of all my studies, this has been what has mostly shaped me and actually helped me with programming, because it helped me find ways to learn new things and also gave me the problem solving mindset that prepared me for programming.
